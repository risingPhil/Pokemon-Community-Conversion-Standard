// By keeping it uncompressed, it gets stored in EWRAM, where it won't hinder us.
// But it does mean that it still takes up 8 KB in the rom.
// Just for reference: when compressing it with ZX0 AND only storing the "changed" bits for PKMN
// evolutions in relation to their base forms, we could bring the size down to 4641 bytes.
// But alas, the IWRAM consumption at a critical point in time made this approach unviable.
// TODO: we might be able to load similar data from the game cartridges.
// However, it turns out the data is different between the R/S/E and FR/LG games.
// So we would have to store "patches"/differences if we go this route.
// It also means we'd have to figure out rom offsets for every single gen III game variant/localization.

/**
 * Okay, here's the thing: to reduce the rom size, we compressed a bunch of data with ZX0
 * Among this data are various data tables that were previously just stored as const arrays.
 *
 * But, during the mystery_gift_builder/mystery_gift_injector execution,
 * these data tables are used intensely, because you're not using them for single pokémon, but rather for boxes of pokémon.
 *
 * Decompression is not cheap, so we can't afford to decompress the tables again and again for every pokémon we deal with
 * during this flow.
 *
 * This is where this class comes in. It is basically a holder of these tables. The idea is to pass it along with the mystery_gift_builder
 * and have it lazy decompress the tables AND charsets it needs. This way when we are dealing with multiple pokémon, we are not decompressing
 * the same data every time and thereby make performance suffer.
 *
 * It DOES have a significant IWRAM cost though. The intention is to just allocate this struct on the stack.
 * As far as I can tell, our stack is not really restricted at all. It just fills up the IWRAM as needed. So we need to be careful not to
 * overwrite/corrupt any code or data we specifically tagged to be stored in IWRAM.
