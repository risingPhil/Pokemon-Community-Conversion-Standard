The Pokemon Community Conversion Standard is a C++ library designed to have a small handful of standard ways to convert a Pokemon from Generation 1 or Generation 2 to Generation 3 that are agreed upon by the community. It is by no means official, but is meant to become a standard that the community can agree on. Not every method is perfect for every situation, so there are a few options. This is meant to be a community standard, so please feel free to suggest changes and modifiations! Currently only original has been implemented- the other three are on their way!

Here is the current list of conversion methods:

## FAITHFUL:
This method is designed to keep as much original information about your Pokemon as possible, even if it might cause a few issues down the road. For instance, a Generation 2 Pokemon transferred with this method will have a Game of Origin of HeartGold. While this Pokemon will be legal if transferred immediately to Generation 4, it would become illegal if it recieved the Champion Ribbon beforehand. Mythical Pokemon are treated the same as all other Pokemon and not modified to match their events.

## LEGAL:
This method is designed to make the transferred Pokemon indistiguishable from a completely normal Generation 3 Pokemon. This will sacrifice specific things (such as Game of Origin) for the peace of mind knowing that you will have no issues bringing your Pokemon to the most recent generation. Mythical Pokemon are converted into their event forms in order to maintain transferrability.

## VIRTUAL:
This method replicates the conversion method used by Poke Transporter when bringing Pokemon from the Virtual Console releases of Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal into Pokemon Bank. Some aspects such as the GameBoy Origin Mark and hidden abilities are not carried over, due to not existing in Generation 3. Mythical Pokemon will be treated as any other Pokemon, outside of getting 5 max IVs instead of 3.

## ORIGINAL:
This method was created for the original release of Poke Transporter GB and is kept as a legacy conversion method. This mostly follows the Virtual Console method, but will sanitize mythical Pokemon into their event forms.
